You‚Äôre correct that managing different configurations and assets for each app
 can be a challenge when using a single codebase. Here are some strategies you 
 might consider:

Configuration Files: You could have a separate configuration file for each app 
in its respective branch. This file could include the unique projectId for each 
app. When you build your app with Expo, you could use a script to copy the 
correct configuration file based on the current branch.

Asset Folders: You could have a separate asset folder for each app. 
These folders could live in the root directory of your project, and you could
 have a script that copies the correct assets into your assets directory based
  on the current branch before building your app.

Git Strategies: When merging changes from the common branch into the app-specific
 branches, you could use git strategies to prevent overwriting the unique
  configurations and assets for each app. For example, you could use the ours 
  merge strategy to keep the app-specific configurations and assets when merging.

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might structure your project:

/my-app
|-- /assets
|   |-- /doctor-bot
|   |-- /lawyer-bot
|   |-- /technician-bot
|-- /config
|   |-- doctor-bot.json
|   |-- lawyer-bot.json
|   |-- technician-bot.json
|-- /src
|   |-- App.js
|   |-- ...

In this structure, assets and config directories contain app-specific 
assets and configurations. Before building your app, 
you could use a script to copy the correct 
assets and configuration file based on the current branch.

Remember, these are just suggestions and the best 
approach depends on your specific needs and constraints.
 Good luck with your project! üöÄ



how can i use script to copy the correct asset and configuration file ?
Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

You can use a simple Node.js script to copy the correct assets and configuration file based on the current branch. Here‚Äôs an example:

JavaScript

const fs = require('fs');
const child_process = require('child_process');

// Get the current branch name
const branchName = child_process.execSync('git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD').toString().trim();

// Define the paths for your assets and config
const assetsPath = `./commonAssets/${branchName}`;
const configPath = `./config/${branchName}.json`;

// Copy the assets
fs.copyFileSync(assetsPath, './assets');

// Copy the config
fs.copyFileSync(configPath, './config.json');
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
This script gets the current branch name using the git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD command, then uses that to determine the paths for the assets and configuration file. It then copies these files to the correct locations.

You can run this script before you build your app with Expo. If you‚Äôre using npm scripts, you could add a ‚Äúprebuild‚Äù script to your package.json that runs this script.

Remember to install the fs and child_process modules using npm if they‚Äôre not already installed in your project. You can install them using the following commands:

npm install fs
npm install child_process

Please note that this is a basic example and might need to be adjusted based on your project‚Äôs specific needs and structure. Always make sure to test your scripts thoroughly to ensure they‚Äôre working as expected. Good luck with your project! üöÄ

this is my app.json file, can i keep name and all variable ?
Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

Yes, you can keep the name and all other variables in your app.json file. However, you‚Äôll need to change certain fields for each app, such as the name, slug, icon, splash.image, android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage, android.package, and extra.eas.projectId.

You could create a separate app.json file for each app in its respective branch. This file would include the unique configuration for each app. When you build your app with Expo, you could use a script to copy the correct app.json file based on the current branch.

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might modify the previous script to also handle the app.json file:

JavaScript

const fs = require('fs');
const child_process = require('child_process');

// Get the current branch name
const branchName = child_process.execSync('git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD').toString().trim();

// Define the paths for your assets, config, and app.json
const assetsPath = `./commonAssets/${branchName}`;
const configPath = `./config/${branchName}.json`;
const appJsonPath = `./app-${branchName}.json`;

// Copy the assets
fs.copyFileSync(assetsPath, './assets');

// Copy the config
fs.copyFileSync(configPath, './config.json');

// Copy the app.json
fs.copyFileSync(appJsonPath, './app.json');
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In this script, app-${branchName}.json is the app.json file for the current branch. The script copies this file to ./app.json before building the app.

Remember, these are just suggestions and the best approach depends on your specific needs and constraints. Always make sure to test your scripts thoroughly to ensure they‚Äôre working as expected. Good luck with your project! üöÄ



with this approch, i don't think we need make any branches for different apps, we can simply run the script, mentioning the app name, we can check if that is a correct app name, and then copy/replace the files based on the script
Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre absolutely right! If the differences between the apps are confined to configuration and assets, you can manage everything from a single branch with a well-structured project and a smart script. Here‚Äôs how you could modify the script to accept an app name as an argument:

JavaScript

const fs = require('fs');

// Get the app name from the command line arguments
const appName = process.argv[2];

// Check if the app name is valid
if (!['doctor-bot', 'lawyer-bot', 'technician-bot'].includes(appName)) {
  console.error(`Invalid app name: ${appName}`);
  process.exit(1);
}

// Define the paths for your assets, config, and app.json
const assetsPath = `./commonAssets/${appName}`;
const configPath = `./config/${appName}.json`;
const appJsonPath = `./app-${appName}.json`;

// Copy the assets
fs.copyFileSync(assetsPath, './assets');

// Copy the config
fs.copyFileSync(configPath, './config.json');

// Copy the app.json
fs.copyFileSync(appJsonPath, './app.json');
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
You can run this script with the app name as an argument, like so: node script.js doctor-bot.

This approach allows you to maintain a single codebase and easily propagate changes across all apps, while still allowing for app-specific configurations and assets. As always, make sure to thoroughly test your scripts and builds to ensure everything is working as expected. Good luck with your project! üöÄ



you think this will work with, expo go build as expo will create only one project, so i will be able to build different app with this approach right ?
Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

Yes, this approach should work with Expo. When you run expo build, Expo uses the configuration in the app.json file in your project directory. By using a script to swap out the app.json file (and any other app-specific files) before you run expo build, you can effectively build different apps from the same codebase.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

Expo Project ID: Each Expo project has a unique ID that is used to identify your project on Expo‚Äôs servers. If you‚Äôre using EAS Build, this ID is specified in the extra.eas.projectId field of your app.json file. You‚Äôll need to create a new project on Expo for each app, and specify the correct project ID in the app.json file for each app.

Android Package Name and iOS Bundle ID: These identifiers must be unique for each app you publish to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. You‚Äôll need to specify a unique package name and bundle ID in the app.json file for each app.

Assets: If your apps have different icons, splash screens, or other assets, you‚Äôll need to manage these assets for each app. You could do this by having a separate assets directory for each app, and using your script to copy the correct assets before building.

Remember to thoroughly test each app before publishing to ensure everything is working as expected. Good luck with your project! üöÄ
